A little breaking news ticker for practising api handling.

Changed api to Gnews as I ran out of free time on newscatcher. 
Still need to check for paginating options, as it does not seem to be included in the free tier.

Consist of
- light / dark mode
- options to search and filter

React, Typescript and Sass
